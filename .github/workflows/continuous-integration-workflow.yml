      # As part of this, we have to copy loom-common's `package.json` to its `out` folder.
      # This is needed because lerna expects loom-common/out to be an npm package (which it only is if it has a package.json file)
      # Normally, this is done as part of the build process, but it also needs to be done for a fresh install.
